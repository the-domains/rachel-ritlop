My name is Rachel Ritlop, and I am a career and business coach to individuals in their 20s and 30s wanting to feel passionate about their work.

### I'M ALL ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE TURN THEIR DREAM JOB INTO REALITY. 

Right now, you are probably feeling scared, overwhelmed, lost, and confused. Maybe you are working a 9-5 and dreading each day as you get dressed for work. Maybe you haven't started your career or business yet because you have_no idea_ where to start. You probably are afraid of making the wrong decision and regretting it 10 years from now... so instead you aren't making any decisions, which has left you feeling "stuck" or "unfulfilled". Maybe you are even lacking clarity about what it is you even_want to do._

### LISTEN, I TOTALLY GET THE FEAR. I'VE BEEN THERE TOO. I FELT LIKE I HAD A MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB, AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE IT LED... BUT WHAT I LEARNED THROUGHOUT MY CAREER (AND EVENTUALLY STARTING MY OWN COACHING BUSINESS), IS THAT MOUNTAIN LED TO A LIFE OF PURPOSE. A LIFE OF PASSION, HAPPINESS, AND JOY.
